## Signal Messaging app

When we look for alternatives to WhatsApp, one app which suddenly comes on the table of options is Signal.

Pros:

- Gold standard encryption, even WhatsApp uses it.
- You can communicate without exposing your phone number.

Cons:

- There is no explicit limit to the number of people that can be added to a Signal group chat. However, if the group becomes very large, it can become difficult to manage, and you may notice that messages take a bit longer to send. Update: There is a limit of 1k members, not sure if performance wise it will still be a problem or not.
- No threads / channels support as we have in discord, slack & MS Teams. Threads & Channels helps to organize discussion on different topics / issues.
