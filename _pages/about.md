My name is **Talha Asghar**, and I am a dedicated **Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Deep Learning**. I completed my **Bachelor's in Computer Science** in 2021 from [Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering & Information Technology](https://kfueit.edu.pk/), where I graduated as a **Gold Medalist** ðŸ¥‡ for my academic excellence. This achievement reflects my commitment to continuous learning and problem-solving in the field of computer science.

After completing my bachelor's degree, I simultaneously started my **Master's in Computer Science** with a specialization in **Artificial Intelligence** at the [National University of Science & Technology](https://nust.edu.pk/), while beginning my career as a **Associate Software Engineer (Backend)** at [Convergence Business Systems](https://convergence.pk/) in 2017. The flexibility of my remote role has allowed me to effectively balance my job and academic pursuits, enabling me to further my expertise in AI and software development without compromising either commitment. This dual focus has enriched my understanding of both backend technologies and AI, positioning me to stay at the forefront of emerging technologies.

I have accumulated over three years of hands-on experience designing and developing robust backend systems while integrating AI and Deep Learning solutions to enhance business applications. My unique combination of practical experience and advanced academic training in AI enables me to bridge the gap between software engineering and cutting-edge technologies, bringing valuable insights to the projects I work on.
